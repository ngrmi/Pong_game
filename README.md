# Pong_game
  A simple pong game made using the turtle library for Python.

Instructions:
Player 1 is on the left hand side of the screen and uses keyboard controls Q as an up arrow and A as a down arrow.
Player 2 is on the right hand side of the screen and uses the up- and down arrows respectively to control their paddle.

If the ball exceeds the limit that is the screen width, the player whose paddle is on the opposite side of where the 
ball exceeded the line gets a point; and vice versa.

Players can decide the amount of rounds to play before the game starts. The game is won by getting the most points
out of the entered rounds. E.g if the rounds entered are 3, and player 1 gets 2 points over 2 rounds, while player 2
gets 1 point during the last round, player 1 wins the game.

Features:
Ball that changes color when it bounces on either of the paddles.
Score counter for both players.
User-generated amount of rounds to play.
Message in center of screen with final results after all rounds have been played:
        Player 1 wins
        Player 2 wins
        It's a draw
